We will release the code very soon~~~ Sorry the server was done (and still done sadly :<) We will release the code asap when the server back on


EMP-SSL: Towards Self-Supervised Learning in One Training Epoch
Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "EMP-SSL: Towards Self-Supervised Learning in One Training Epoch" by Shengbang Tong, Yubei Chen, Yi Ma, and Yann Lecun. The paper proposes a new approach to self-supervised learning (SSL) called Extreme-Multi-Patch Self-Supervised-Learning (EMP-SSL) which is able to converge in a few epochs, significantly reducing the number of epochs compared to conventional SSL methods.
